# Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project

**Objective:**
The Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project aims to leverage SQL-based data analysis to provide insights for optimizing inventory and potentially closing a storage facility. The project utilizes the Mint Classics relational database, exploring key questions related to inventory distribution, sales correlation, and identification of stagnant items.

## Project Tasks

1. **Database Setup:**
   - The [`mintclassicsDB.sql`](link-to-your-mintclassicsDB.sql-file) script is used to create a comprehensive nine-table relational database in MySQL Workbench.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Key questions related to inventory, storage, and sales are addressed using SQL queries.
   - Warehouse distribution, inventory-sales correlation, and identification of stagnant items are explored.

3. **Data-Driven Recommendations:**
   - Recommendations are formulated based on the analysis to optimize inventory and potentially close a storage facility.
   - Findings are presented in a clear and actionable manner, addressing areas for improvement in inventory management.

## Key Findings

1. **Warehouse Distribution:**
   - Items are distributed across North, East, West, and South warehouses, suggesting potential for rearrangement to optimize storage.

2. **Inventory-Sales Correlation:**
   - The analysis reveals the correlation between inventory numbers and sales figures, identifying items with low sales and high inventory for further scrutiny.

3. **Stagnant Items:**
   - The project identifies a stagnant item, the "1985 Toyota Supra," with no recorded sales, suggesting a potential candidate for removal from the product line.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimizing Storage Facility:**
   - Consider rearranging items within warehouses to maximize space utilization.
   - Evaluate the possibility of eliminating or downsizing a storage facility.

2. **Inventory Management:**
   - Review products with low sales and high inventory for potential reduction in orders.
   - Consider discontinuing items with poor performance to streamline the product line.

3. **Product Line Optimization:**
   - Assess stagnant items for potential removal or revitalization in the product line.
   - Focus on high-performing products to enhance overall sales.

## Conclusion

The Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project successfully utilizes SQL queries to explore and analyze the provided database, offering actionable insights for improving inventory management. The findings and recommendations provide a valuable foundation for strategic decision-making in the context of warehouse distribution, sales correlation, and product line optimization. The project's documentation is clear, well-structured, and serves as a valuable resource for addressing inventory-related challenges in the classic model car retail industry.
