# Mint Classics Inventory Optimization Project

## Objective

Mint Classics Company, a retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, is seeking data-driven insights to optimize inventory and potentially close a storage facility. As a data analyst, the goal is to utilize MySQL Workbench to explore the provided Mint Classics relational database, identifying patterns and factors that can inform inventory reorganization and reduction.

## Key Challenges

- Explore current inventory and understand product distribution.
- Identify factors influencing inventory reorganization/reduction.
- Provide analytical insights and recommendations based on the data.

## Project Tasks

### Database Setup

1. Download `mintclassicsDB.sql` and use MySQL Workbench to create the Mint Classics database.
2. Ensure successful execution for a nine-table relational database with relevant company data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Pose relevant questions about inventory, storage, and sales.
2. Write SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the Mint Classics database.

#### Key Questions to Address

- Where are items stored? Can warehouse elimination be considered through rearrangement?
- How are inventory numbers correlated with sales figures? Are counts appropriate for each item?
- Are stagnant items present? Identify candidates for removal from the product line.

### Data-Driven Recommendations

1. Formulate suggestions based on analysis to optimize inventory and potentially close a storage facility.
2. Present findings in a clear and actionable manner.

## Instructions

- Utilize MySQL Workbench in your local environment for off-platform execution.
